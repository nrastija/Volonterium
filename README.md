# Volonterium
Volunteer management application. Created in Tauri (Rust backend + Vue.js frontend) using the npm package. This application bases on the management of volunteer activities, allowing administrators to handle volunteer data, events, and feedback efficiently.

## Project Idea
The main basis of this project is implementing a SQLite database with CRUD operations and two triggers. This project is my own implementation idea for the mandatory project of Databases 2 course at my 3rd year, 5th semester [URL Link](https://nastava.foi.hr/course/214493/2022-2023).
